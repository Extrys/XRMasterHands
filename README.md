## Introduction

XRMasterHands is designed to simplify the implementation of OpenXR hand tracking using Unity's Input System, making it significantly easier for developers to add hand interactions to their projects. This tool streamlines the integration process, enabling developers to focus more on creativity and less on technical complexities.

This project is open source.

For general troubleshooting, support, or to report a bug, please submit an issue with the appropriate tag on this repo.  
If you have a fix or an enhancement to propose, feel free to submit a pull request.

*As i have a slight level of dyslextia, im sory before hand (never better said) for any typo you may find, feel free to contribute fixing them if you find any!*

## Features

- Generated Hand Proxy Device
  - Automatically generates hand controllers for seamless integration with Unity's Input System, simplifying the setup process and enhancing usability within VR applications.
- Pose Descriptor for Easy Device Generation Authoring
  - Utilize the pose descriptor to author and customize the hand controllers effortlessly. Add your own poses and integrate joystick simulators to adapt the controllers to specific needs and functionalities.
  by adding your own poses and joystick simulators
- Simple Skeleton Driver
  - Offers straightforward control over hand skeletons, simplifying interactions with hand rigs
- Joystick Simulator Framework
  - Incorporate your own joystick logic into the hand controllers.
- Extends XR Hand Controller ***(WORK IN PROGRESS)***
  - Enhances XR hand controllers by adding advanced features such as velocity tracking and finger state recognition.
